Hello, world!

I’ve been thinking for a long time about sharing my experiences and thoughts—putting myself out there, sharing what I know, and hopefully helping others (and myself) along the way.

I’m a software developer, and I’ve been coding since I was 11 years old. Back then, I did it just for fun, never worrying about making money. Over the years, my passion for learning new things, creating and (sometimes) breaking stuff, and solving problems never left me. But as I got older, I realized bills don’t pay themselves. I started learning things just to get a job, and that led to burnout. I felt trapped, but today, my friend, I feel free.

I’m starting a new chapter in my life: I want to improve my English, become a better developer, and dive into the things I love. In a couple of years, I want to look back and feel proud that I made this decision. And you, my friend—the one reading this—I want you to be part of this journey. 

Now, let me tell you a bit more about myself.

My name is Luis Moncada, and I’m 26 years old. I was born in San Cristóbal, Venezuela, also known as “La ciudad de la cordialidad” (The City of Cordiality). My dad’s an Industrial Engineer, and my mom is a homemaker. I have a little sister who’s just a tiny bit smarter than me (but don’t tell her I said that).

I grew up in Valencia, Venezuela, which is where I discovered my passion for soccer and technology, and I met some amazing friends who are still in my life today.

When I was about 12, my best friend introduced me to this game called “Habbo.” Honestly, it felt more like a social network than a game, but it was super popular in Venezuela. I’d play it every day after school and ended up meeting people from all over. One day, someone in the game invited me to join this “Habbo Retro” site—a fan-made version of Habbo—and I was blown away by the fact that people were creating their own looks and custom content. I remember thinking, “Wow, I want to learn how to do that!”

That curiosity led me to tutorials on YouTube and forums, and that’s when I realized I needed to learn some coding to launch my own Habbo server. I started teaching myself, and that was the spark that lit my passion for tech.

Later, I went to the Universidad de Carabobo to study Computer Science. I was so excited to learn more about technology and programming. Unfortunately, things were complicated—Venezuela’s public universities were in a tough spot (and let’s be honest, the whole government situation was rough). While I there, I often played soccer. One day, after a game, I was in a horrible car accident. The car hit a pothole, my friend lost control, and we crashed into a wall. I was in the back seat and was thrown forward, badly injuring my right arm. It was so severe that my elbow was completely shattered, and I almost lost my arm.

I spent a month in the hospital, underwent 14 surgeries, and had a medical device on my arm for almost 11 months. Thankfully, I recovered my arm, but I lost a lot of movement. I had to relearn how to do everything—like writing—using my left hand. I spent nearly a year in bed, using that time to continue my studies.

Eventually, a friend told me about someone who needed a website. I jumped at the opportunity. After that, I started asking around and building websites for people, earning a bit more. Then a friend introduced me to someone in Puerto Rico who needed a developer. That was my first time working with people outside of Venezuela. I saved enough money to travel to Florida, and New York.I loved New York, but at the time, I had no idea I’d actually end up living someday.

A couple of years later, in 2020, the pandemic hit, and Venezuela’s situation got even worse. My dad started having problems at his job because the government began threatening him. So, we made the decision to leave the country. We moved to New York City, where my aunt and uncle live.

And here I am now! I’ve already shared a lot about myself, but maybe in a future post, I’ll talk about adapting to the United States, especially life in New York City.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you’ll stick around for more of my story!
